    <h2>What does it mean to display inline vs. inline-blocks?</h2>
      <div>
      <p class = "answer">Display properties are used in CSS to lay out elements on a webpage. Two widely used display properties are display: inline and display: 
        inline-block. Before explaining what they do respectively, I think it is necessary to explain what block level elements do. Block level 
        elements always stack on top of each other even when there’s enough space to be side by side. The default width is 100% and even when the
        width is less, a new line of content is forced automatically. This is good for things like paragraphs. The most common block elements are 
        p and div. <br>
      </p>

        <h3>Inline:</h3>
      <p class = "answer">In contrast to block elements, inline elements display side by side, as they live inside other things and don’t force new lines. The width 
        is determined by the size of its content as opposed to 100%. This is good for when you don’t want a new line of content. However, the 
        limitation of display: inline is that you cannot change the height of the element. Padding and margins still apply, but they cannot be used 
        to change the height visibly. <br>
        Common inline elements include: a span img and button
      </p>             
        <h3>Inline-block:</h3> 
      <p class = "answer">display: inline-block is a combination block and inline, as the name suggests. We can set the height and width properties as well as place 
        elements side by side. We can also set the margin and padding the same way you could with a block level element, but also allow the elements 
        to not force new lines. <br>
        <br>  
        Below are examples of the different ways in which elements can be displayed using display: display:block, display: inline and display: inline-block.
