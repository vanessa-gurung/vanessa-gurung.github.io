    <h2> 1.	Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values. </h2>
    <div>
      <h3> Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, 
       and the consequences of your action. </h3>
        <p class = "answer">
          Working in public libraries for over five years has put me in quite a few predicaments where ethical decisions had to be made. Most of them 
          occurred when I worked at Central City Library, where many rough sleepers would inhabit. There was one instance on a shift where I caught a regular rough sleeper 
          taking some newspaper from our collection and scrunching the pages to put under his sweater to keep himself warm. I mean, ideally, he shouldn’t have been using what 
          would be considered ‘council property,’ but I wasn't going to rat him out over something that wouldn’t have had to happen if ‘the system’ didn’t fail him. Had I narked,
          a security incident report would’ve been written up, which are done to keep a record of trouble patrons. After a certain amount of ‘offences,’ they’ll be trespassed 
          from the library. That played into my decision of not reporting anything, despite that being the correct protocol. Instead, I just told him we had heaps of scrap paper, 
          which he could ask for at the desk at any time. I think that was the best outcome for all parties involved– he learnt he could just ask for paper, I didn’t have to write 
          a report and the newspapers remained undamaged (I mean not the best, cause ideally he wouldn't have to do this at all, but you know what I mean). I guess the main value that 
          informed my decision was compassion, since I knew he relied on library resources and I didn’t want him kicked out. But also, it just seemed like a no brainer that 
          someone’s basic needs are more important than minor council property?
        </p>

      <h3> Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity. </h3>
        <p class = "answer">
          Being a second generation immigrant from Nepal, growing up in Auckland, I had a bit of a hard time navigating my identity. It was pretty frustrating for the most part 
          because it seemed split a lot of the time – who I was at home vs who I was outside of. It’s kind of silly thinking about it in retrospect, because it was all me, but
          it felt like two different people when I was younger. I had a pretty sheltered upbringing and was raised to be a helpful, studious daughter (classic Asian expectations).
          And for the most part I was, but my interests differed significantly from my parents. They wanted me to do engineering and I did for a year, but I dropped out because 
          I didn’t really like anything about it. I ended up going to art school, where I felt much more ‘myself.’ I guess to some degree, that’s what art school’s largely about, 
          being your ‘authentic self.’ It was quite a shift in mentality, going from my collectivist mindset at home to an extreme individualistic mindset at art school, but I 
          think the latter made me realise the importance of authenticity. While the former taught me to value family, loyalty, dependability and tolerance. I think above all though, 
          practicing compassion has always been something I’ve tried to live by, cause it’s important in every facet of life -work, home, anywhere else. Most people are having 
          a stink time, we should be understanding and nice to one another.

    <h2> 2.	Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations. </h2>
    <div>
      <h3>	Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
        <p class = "answer">
          I think I have a fairly high emotional intelligence. My ability to understand and regulate the emotions of myself and others have allowed me to work well team settings, 
          which has always been the case throughout my career in libraries. I’ve always had to collaborate with others (co-workers, community members, external organizations) for 
          projects. <br>
          Also, having the experience of doing a research masters, I know that I have the ability to work independently as well and that, when push comes to shove, I can get things done. <br>
          My limitations have usually stemmed from inconsistency – my previous study habits haven’t been the best. I can spend a lot of time researching and tricking myself into thinking 
          it’s productive, but it’s essentially just a form of procrastination. I spend time pretending to do work to avoid doing the real work.
        </p>

      <h3>	Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles. </h3>
       <p class = "answer">
        As aforementioned, I think having a high EI will be beneficial at Dev, since we’ll be working regularly and closely in teams. I think when encountering an obstacle as a team, 
        it’s imperative that the team works well together. This means each individual having self-awareness: knowing themselves and their strengths/weaknesses, but also being able to 
        compromise. You can have a team full of geniuses, but if none of them have EQ, they probably won’t work well together.
      </p>  

      <h3>	Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used
            at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
        <p class = "answer">
          There have inevitably been moments where I’ve encountered friction with co-workers. My usual response has been to just compromise, because I don’t really like spending too 
           much time over things that don’t have significant consequences (this has mostly to do with the nature of my previous job as a librarian). I think this method’s been effective in that 
           it allows for the team to move on and co-workers have always liked me for this reason. <br>
           I think if I were put in the situation above where there were significant consequences, I would spend more time communicating, listening and building that trust with my team members. 
          </p>

  <h1 class ="simpsons" id="LP"> Learning Plan </h1>
  <div>
    <h2>1.	What is your long term goal or career pathway? </h2>
        <p class = "answer"> 
          Hopefully web design. 
        </p>
    
    <h2>2.  A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
          <p class = "answer">
            Strengths would include being creative, which I think helps a lot with problem solving. Creativity aids in looking at a problem from different angles before finding 
            the best solution. <br>
            Another strength of mine would be having a fairly high emotional intelligence. I think Dev is quite a social learning environment, so having a high EI is good for my 
            learning, as well as those around me (who I hopefully can help). <br> 
            My biggest limitation is hesitancy, which probably has something to do with low confidence. Coding is a new thing to me and I feel pretty dumb whenever learning 
            something new about it (which has been like everything so far), which is natural. But I tend to get fixated on anything I don’t understand completely. When I hit a 
            bump in the road, I worry a lot that it’ll affect me further down the line and I spend too much time on it. And if I don’t understand it after a while of doing my 
            own research, I feel like there’s something wrong with me and I get embarrassed about asking for help, which puts me even further behind. I know this is silly!
          </p> 
    
    <h2>3.	What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
          <p class = "answer">
            Ideally, I would like to feel more confident with myself in several ways – having more discipline, being able to ask questions, being able to ‘network’ without feeling 
            phony... like just accepting that’s a part of being an adult.
          </p> 
    
    <h2>4.	A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h2>
      <h3>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives </h3>
          <p class = "answer">
            Being aware, respectful and helpful when I can when working with others. Also be conscious of how time is being used?
          </p> 
      <h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you </h3>
          <p class = "answer">
            Firstly, acknowledge when this is happening to me and actively try to do something about it, rather than ignoring it. I feel like people are often told to just persevere 
            through hard times and this probably does work for some people, but I don’t think I’m one of those people... Breaking down big jobs into smaller tasks through writing 
            lists helps me a lot, because it 1) makes overwhelming things feel manageable and 2) helps me organise the steps that need to be taken to finish the task. Also, listening 
            to my body and knowing when to take a break is good for stressful times.
          </p>  
    
    <h2>5.	A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
          <p class = "answer">
            This is definitely something I would like to improve on. I think giving myself a strict amount of time to do my own research to solve/understand the issue I have and if I 
            haven’t managed to solve/understand it in that time frame, then to ask for help from peers and/or facilitators.
          </p> 

    <h2>6.	A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
          <p class = "answer">
            Help, encouragement, respect, compassion, friendliness, hot tips
          </p> 

    <h2>7.	Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's 
            important to plan these in.</h2>
          <p class = "answer">
            I’ve sort of let my friends and family know I’ll be bogged down with coding school for four months, so I haven’t made any significant plans and I don’t have any major 
          obligations, luckily.

  <h1 class ="simpsons" id="EQ"> Emotional Intelligence</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
          <p class = "answer">
            EQ is a person’s ability to recognize emotions in oneself and others. It is also using this awareness to regulate emotions and make good decisions. 
          </p> 
      <h2>How is it different to IQ</h2>
          <p class = "answer">
            IQ is a measurement of different qualities that make up our intelligence, such as problem solving skills, analytical thinking, short term memory and spatial recognition. 
            It is used to measure a person’s inherent intelligence, independent from any facts or knowledge they’ve gained over the course of their life. Whereas EQ is largely gained 
            from life experiences and can be improved through self-awareness and personal development training. 
          </p> 
      <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
          <p class = "answer">
            Emotions help us understand and relate to others, learn new things and have a significant influence on our actions and they help us to lead fulfilled lives. Emotions can 
            be difficult to manage though, so having EQ is necessary to harness our emotions in positive way. It allows us to effectively communicate with others and to be able to relate 
            to them on a deeper level. This is beneficial for any context really, but particularly in the workplace where one has to work in a team or manage people.

<h1 class ="simpsons" id="NGM"> Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>1.	Research Neuroplasticity </h2>
        <h3> Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h3>
          <p class = "answer">
            Neuroplasticity describes how the brain can change throughout life by adapting, learning and recovering. Just by knowing that the brain is malleable, people can perform 
            better at whatever task they’re doing. Through neuroplasticity, people can recover from brain events and injuries, enhance memory abilities, various cognitive abilities and learn more 
            effectively. 
          </p>
        <h3> Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h3>
          <p class = "answer"> 
            I think I’ve always been prone to scepticism and pessimism. My default is to always just assume maybe not the worst, but like not much. This is what I’ve believed to be a 
            coping mechanism for most of my adult life, because having low expectations means rarely getting disappointed, but that’s probably not a healthy way to think constantly??? I’m pretty keen to 
            like ... think about things more positively (writing that was embarrassing for me), which I think the principles of neuroplasticity could definitely help with. Like telling myself “I’m the 
            shit!” every day – if I do it enough, maybe I will genuinely think it one day?! 
          </p>
        <h3> What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
          <p class = "answer">
            Creating art, which boosts introspection, memory, attention and focus. I can attest to this! When I used to draw diary comics regularly, I noticed I was way more observant 
            of things and the practice made my memory a lot better in a couple of ways – I would make sure to take mental notes of the occurrence that I would want to draw later, and the muscle memory 
            in my hand would also improve. Because they were comics about me and my experiences, I’d be doing a lot of introspection throughout the process as well. I should really get back into it ...
          <br> Other ways include but are not limited to: meditation/yoga, reading and learning an instrument. 
        </p>

            I don’t think it necessarily relates to neuroplasticity in the most obvious way, but sleeping is very important for improving neuroplasticity. It’s also just a nice video. 
          </p>
    
      <h2>2.   Research Growth Mindset</h2>
        <h3> Discuss what it is and why it is relevant. </h3>
          <p class = "answer">
            A growth mindset is the belief that that new abilities and intelligence can be developed through practice and time. Individuals with a growth mindset see problems as 
            opportunities to learn rather than chances of failure. 
          </p>
        <h3> In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
          <p class = "answer"> 
            I found out that I 100% have a fixed mindset especially when Dweck phrased, “the Tyranny of Now.” It’s not because I want to be that way, I really would like to switch 
            to a growth mindset, it’s just that I grew up with a fixed mindset mentality because of school and my culture. Now that I know about neuroplasticity though, maybe that can change! 
          </p>
        <h3> How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
          <p class = "answer">
            I feel like I almost already have? Like prior to Dev, I felt this inherent need to try to understand concepts before moving on, getting very caught up on details (maybe 
            this was somewhat due to the subject I was studying), but now I’ve accepted that this way of learning doesn’t really seem to apply to how learning is done at Dev. I feel this is a change 
            is a step in the right direction towards a growth mindset, as it’s a less rigid way of studying. I’m thinking that I’ll eventually get the concept, because I’ll have the opportunity to 
            understand later on in the course.

            I will remind myself to not be deterred, because it’s an opportunity to learn and that I will be able to move forward with perseverance and/or help. And that the more I practice that thing 
            I’m feeling uncomfortable with, the more likely I’ll be able to wrap my head around it.
