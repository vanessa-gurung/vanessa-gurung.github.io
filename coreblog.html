    <h2> 1.	Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values. </h2>
    <div>
     <p> Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, 
     and the consequences of your action. </p>
     Working in public libraries for over five years has put me in quite a few predicaments where ethical decisions had to be made. Most of them occurred when I worked 
     at Central City Library, where many rough sleepers would inhabit. There was one instance on a shift where I caught a regular rough sleeper taking some newspaper 
     from our collection and scrunching the pages to put under his sweater. This was during winter, so this wasn’t an unordinary thing to do, he was just trying to keep 
     himself warm. I mean, ideally, he shouldn’t have been using what would be considered ‘council property,’ but there was no way I would rat him out over something that 
     wouldn’t have had to happen if ‘the system’ didn’t fail him. Had I narked, a security incident report would’ve been written up, which are done to keep a record of 
     trouble patrons. After a certain amount of ‘offences,’ they’ll be trespassed from the library. That played into my decision of not reporting anything, despite that 
     being the correct protocol. Instead, I just told him we had heaps of scrap paper, which he could ask for at the desk at any time. I think that was the best outcome 
     for all parties involved– he learnt he could just ask for paper, I didn’t have to write a report and the newspapers remained undamaged. I guess the main value that 
     informed my decision was compassion, since I knew he relied on library resources and I didn’t want him kicked out. But also, it just seemed like a no brainer that 
     someone’s basic needs are more important than minor council property?

    <p> Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity. </p>
    Being a second generation immigrant from Nepal, growing up in Auckland, I had a bit of a hard time navigating my identity. It was pretty frustrating for the most part 
    because it seemed split a lot of the time – who I was at home vs who I was outside of. It’s kind of silly thinking about it in retrospect, because it was all me, but
    it felt like two different people when I was younger. I had a pretty sheltered upbringing and was raised to be a helpful, studious daughter (classic Asian expectations).
    And for the most part I was, but my interests differed significantly from my parents. They wanted me to do engineering and I did for a year, but I dropped out because 
    I didn’t really like anything about it. I ended up going to art school, where I felt much more ‘myself.’ I guess to some degree, that’s what art school’s largely about, 
    being your ‘authentic self.’ It was quite a shift in mentality, going from my collectivist mindset at home to an extreme individualistic mindset at art school, but I 
    think the latter made me realise the importance of authenticity. While the former taught me to value family, loyalty, dependability and tolerance. I think above all 
    though, practicing compassion has been a

      <p>	Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</p>

      <p>	Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles. </p>


      <p>	Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used
      at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</p>
