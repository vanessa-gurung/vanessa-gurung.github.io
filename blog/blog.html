  <h3> Sprint 1 Tech </h3>
  <h4>Version Control with Git</h4>
     <div>
      <p class="question">What's the difference between Git and GitHub?</p>
      Git is a software that you download onto your computer and does not require any remote servers to use. It is a DVCS – distributed version control system, which
      means multiple people can work on a particular project together without overwriting each other’s changes. It also has a recorded history of changes. Github  
      also uses version control, but it is a service a user signs up to. It is a code host that stores and shares code. <br>

      <p class="question">Can you think of an analogy to describe them? </p>
      Working in a busy kitchen – you work on your own dish, bring it up to the pass for other chefs to inspect, make changes, check the cohesion of flavours between 
      dishes and components. Once everything’s ‘merged,’ they’re sent to the diners (I've been watching a lot of MasterChef recently).

      <p class="question">Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material? </p>
      Yes<br>

      <p class="question">Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?</p>
      Yes
      </div>
<br>
  <h4>Install and Explore Git Reflect</h4>
    <div>
      <p class="question">What is a Git workflow? </p>
      In a typical Git workflow when working with version control, there are three main areas – the working directory, the staging index and the repository. The git 
      shell command is used to move the files from section to section. Files are uploaded in the working directory. Once worked on, they can be moved to the staging 
      index, where all the files that are about to be committed are situated. Once committed, they move to the repository, where those files are saved. 
      <p class="question">	What did you notice about your learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked? </p>
      I found it hard to concentrate on the content after a couple of hours. It didn’t seem too difficult when reading, but it didn’t feel like it was being absorbed 
      either. I think this comes down to needing to familiarise myself fully with the Git terminology, since it’s used throughout the exercises. Everything seems vaguely 
      familiar and I feel like I can piece the sentences together by context but I’m not sure whether I actually understand everything. At a certain point, I wasn’t getting
       the same outcome as the narrator. I attempted to backtrack to figure out what I had done wrong, but it turned into this really overwhelming thing and I ended up just 
       starting the whole thing over again. I’m also tending to take longer than the time box suggestions. 
       <p class="question">	Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration?</p>
      Try to be more efficient with my time – follow the time box suggestions<br>
    </div>
<br>
  <h4>Track and Commit</h4>
    <div>
      <p class="question">How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?</p> 
      These terms are used in a code host software called Git to explain a typical workflow. There are three main areas of this workflow: working directory, staging area and git 
      repository. Files are created or copied to the working directory, where they can be changed. Once they have been worked on, they get moved to the staging area i.e. the files
      are ‘staged.’ This means they are being prepared and collated for a commit which occurs in the git repository. A commit is like a snap shot of the work’s currently staged changes 
      – it saves the changed files to a git repository, which tracks and saves the history of all changes made to the project. 
    </div>
<br>
  <h4> Branch, Pull, Merge</h4>
    <div>
      <p class="question">What is main? </p>
      All repos have a main branch, which is where the best version of the working code lives.
      <p class="question">Why create a branch?</p>
      Creating branches allows you to try out various ideas and ways of coding without affecting the main branch. You can commit changes and experiment using different branches until 
      you’re happy with the changes, whereupon you will let other contributors review it before it is merged with the main.
      <p class="question">Do the concepts in intuitive or difficult to understand?</p>
      Concepts seem to make sense when learning about them but when they come up later, sometimes I’ll have trouble remembering their exact meaning. I guess somewhat intuitive.

  <h3> Sprint 1 Core </h3>
  <h4> Thinking Like a Programmer</h4>
    <div>
      <p class="question">What is your process so far for solving problems?</p>
      I think when it comes to problem solving, I have mostly followed the suggested process – I often plan and then break down my approach into manageable steps. However, I do have the 
      tendency to spend more time than necessary. I think earlier on in the week I was getting caught up on trying to understand everything first and I tended to get caught up on details.
      However, I think as the week has progressed, I’ve been more conscious of this and have been more intentional with my time management. I’ve started to acknowledge when I’ve mulled 
      over something enough and when it’s time to move on (and revisit later). <br>
      Another thing I need to work on is refactoring. As soon as I finish an exercise, I don’t really think of alternative ways or ways to improve the solution. I’m mostly just relieved I 
      managed to accomplish it in the first place...

  <h4>Introduce Yourself</h4>
    <div>
      Hello, I’m Vanessa and I live in Auckland. <br>
      In terms of identity, my Nepali heritage is intrinsic to who I am. I grew up in Auckland, but living in a Nepali household, my core beliefs and values centre around a collectivist 
      mentality. I believe in compassion above all else, because it encompasses understanding, empathy, consideration and kindness. All things that we need to practice to work well together. 
      I think authenticity is also important though. Like, I think we should be doing things for the greater good, but you should be able to do that how you want?? <br> 
      I’m attending Dev, because I like learning and so far I’ve been learning things that have very limited job markets. Studying fine arts and media led me to work in public libraries for
      five years (because ofc they did). I realised I didn’t want a career in libraries, since the only way up is through management and I have 0 leadership skills. A friend in a similar 
      situation got me onto the idea of Dev and it just made sense – the short, intensive structure suited how I would like to learn (cannot spend any more time at uni!), as well as the school’s 
      set of values that align closely with my own. I’ve only had a wee bit of experience coding, but I’m v excited to be learning it. I like how it’s a methodical process but what you do with 
      it can be creative. So, I’m looking forward to the creative possibilities! <br>
      <p class="question">What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers?</p>
      Difficult – values aren’t really things that you think of consciously often, they’re more like an intrinsic part of your being. It was definitely an exercise that made me feel vulnerable. 
      As someone who’s introverted, I find sharing those parts of myself with others hard. I also just didn’t know what tone to take, like am I being too casual and honest right now? But I also 
      thought if I changed it, it would be inauthentic???
      <p class="question">Could you feel your ego? Were you self-conscious? </p>
      Yes, I’m already an extremely self-conscious person to begin with. But knowing that others had to do the same exercise comforted me and I can sense that people in this cohort are kind.

<h2 class="sprinttitle" id="sprint2"> Sprint 2</h2>
  <h3> Sprint 2 Tech </h3>    
  <h4> Your Blog</h4>
    <div>
      <p class="question">Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms? </p> 
      We’ve created a blog and now we are using HTML and CSS to put styled content on it. This requires making an HTML file and CSS file that are linked. These are worked on through VSC and then 
      pushed onto Github through the command line.
      <p class="question">How are you finding working with the timeboxes? </p>
      I made the decision to try to follow the time box suggestions as closely as possible when I finished sprint 1, but almost immediately into sprint 2, I got caught up on an issue regarding 
      pushing my changes, which took me an hour over the time box suggestion of 50 minutes. Very frustrating! I guess it’s bound to happen sometimes, but the steps were so straightforward, I 
      should’ve realised to get help earlier on rather than try several times to no avail. Will try harder on the next chapter.
    </div>  
<br>
  <h4> Learning HTML & CSS</h4>
    <div>
      <p class="question">What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?</p> 
      Trying to make my way through the Guide to Paths chapter under HTML Syntax Problem Set of the Udacity Intro to HTML and CSS course at the end of the day. I don’t think the concept was too 
      difficult to grasp, but it felt like it went on and on. It was so close to the end of the lesson though, so I just persevered. I did acknowledge, however, that I should revisit it the next 
      day with fresh eyes and that helped a lot. <br>
      The Slack card workspace exercise where we’re asked to change several things to fix the code. I think I’m still adjusting my eyes to look at code. I find it really hard to stare at a page of 
      code for longer than ten minutes. After that amount of time, I find it extremely hard to pick out details. So I use command + F a lot to help out with finding whatever the question’s asking 
      about the code. <br> 
      The Udacity Intro to HTML, CSS, and Boxes – so buggy! Spent a bit too long deciding between that and Free code camp once discovered the link didn’t work. Attempted the replacement link, but 
      the images were missing... A class mate figured out a work around with the initial link, but the quizzes didn’t load. Made the decision to just do the videos, write notes and move on. <br>
      <p class="question">What are of you proud of from this challenge?</p>
      Having always been a procrastinator and being someone who gets caught up on details, I think I’m proud of myself for managing my time a lot better during this challenge. I’ve seemed to find 
      a way to study that suits me well – acknowledging what I want to accomplish before I begin and giving myself set times to study and break, so I have something to look forward to. <br> 
      Also, when being tested to make code changes in the last part of the Udacity HTML, CSS Basics course, and being able to, was a moment of pride I guess. 
    </div>
<br>
  <h4> Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge</h4> 
    <div>
      <p class="question"> Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight 
        about the nature of HTML and CSS.  </p>
        HTML and CSS can be compared to my work relationship with one of my previous colleagues, Ann. She was the children’s librarian and I was the youth. We had to work together to organise and 
        deliver events and programmes. I was HTML – the details person who got the work done for the programmes to be able to run, whereas Ann was CSS, the ‘showman,’ who brought the enthusiasm and 
        attracted the patrons. 
      <p class="question"> Any moments of surprise or joy? </p>
      Joy definitely came from any time something wasn’t working and then trying a million different suggestions from google and then finally getting the code to work. This was pretty much my whole CSS 
      experience. <br>
      Also learning Flexbox through Flexbox Froggy (thank Jared!). It really clarified things about element positioning for me. It seems that games and app based learning is for me. I’m also using Mimo 
      to learn and that’s helping a bit. 
      <p class="question"> If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why? </p> 
      HTML would be a beaver, because they build functional things, whereas CSS would probably be one of those birds of paradise you see on David Attenborough documentaries. They’re all about show 
      and attraction.
